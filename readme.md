# Wyze Rule Recommendation Challenge

This is a repository containing code to join the [Wyze Rule Recommendation Challenge](https://huggingface.co/spaces/competitions/wyze-rule-recommendation) at [HuggingFace](huggingface.co).

The Wyze Rule Recommendation Challenge invites data scientists to develop innovative machine learning solutions that recommend customized smart home automation rules to users, using Wyze’s anonymized smart home dataset. This competition aims to push the boundaries of smart home AI while maintaining rigorous data privacy standards. Competitors will train models on rich, real-world smart home data to predict which automation rules each user is likely to benefit from based on their usage patterns and behaviors.

## Objective and Overview
The main goal of this competition is to develop algorithms that can recommend smart home automation rules tailored to each user. Competitors will train models using Wyze’s Rule Recommendation dataset of users’ device list and their existing automation rules. There are no constraints on the types of learning algorithms entrants can leverage. The trained algorithms will be evaluated on their ability to accurately recommend new automation rules missing from a user’s existing rules, in the provided public and private test datasets. Winning solutions will combine predictive accuracy with an understanding of real-world home automation needs, recommending rules that are personalized, helpful, and aligned with each user’s smart home ecosystem and behaviors. This competition provides an exciting opportunity to push intelligent home automation technology forward in a privacy-focused setting.
